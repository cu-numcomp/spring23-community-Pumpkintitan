# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *Rockpool*

This software helps people create and test Spiking Neural Networks. This relates 
to numerical computation because it is under the umbrella of AI/ML. It is still
a neural network under the hood but takes in a time component for when it sends
data to the next node.
